kaggle Competition - Avito Duplicate Ads Detection
In this homework assignment, you will be working on the “Avito Duplicate Ads Detection” competition, which ran between May-July 2016. The competition is available at https: //www.kaggle.com/c/avito-duplicate-ads-detection. You are asked to create a powerful classification models to identify whether a pair of ads are duplicates. As you might expect,
this process will involve building and diagonising numerous (at least hundreds) of models.
This assignment is worth 250 points and has two parts. In the first part of the homework, you will create your own models and will be evaluated on the kaggle leaderboard score of your personal model.
In the second part, which will be due 3/28, you will be asked to aggregate some of the best models from the class to create an even better classifier with higher AUC scores.
